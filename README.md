# About Me

Hey, I am Niranjan. I am a sophomore at Columbia University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am passionate about building scalable full-stack applications that solve real problems for real people.

Lately, I've been exploring AI development through building RAG systems, AI agents, and working with frameworks like LangChain.

## What I Have Been Building

**RAG Notes App** — A full-stack note-taking app with RAG that lets you upload documents, ask questions, and get answers with citations.

**SecureUs** — A safety-rating web app used by 7,000+ people to check neighborhood safety.

**TasteMatch** — A swipe-based food recommendation app that suggests dishes based on your taste and generates a personal taste-profile.
